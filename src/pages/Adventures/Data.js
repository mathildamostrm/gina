We will start at the southernmost point Lindesnes and walk by foot all the way to North Cape the northernmost point of Norway.  34 km north of our home town Honningsvåg. It is an distance around 3000 km and we are planning to take about 3,5 month, about 30 km a day. We will mainly walk through the mountains and nature and avoid the roads as much as it is possible. On this page we will share the route, equipment and our partners who make it possible to take on this journey. It will also come up a blog post once a week here on my website and on my Facebook page and Instagram we will share photos daily if we have phone signal. ',

    description: 'In February 2019 I traversed Lake Baikal from the southernmost point of the lake, Kultuk and walked an distance of 692 kilometers to the northernmost point, Nizhneangarsk. It is a little village about 30 km north of Severbaikalsk where most people finnish their expedition. This expedition is by date the toughest I have ever done. The temperatures was freezing ( night temperatures as low as minus 40) , strong winds that knocked me over severels of times, ice cracks as wide as few meters with open water and maybe the toughest part LONELINESS. I walked most of the days between 50-60km a day without any breaks more than for a drink, eating was done by walking. For me this was my second ever expedition and without a lot of experience it was a real test. I loved Siberia. Lake Baikal is just a place that stands out and you have to experience it to understand what I am talking about. The ice is just incredible and the Lake is something special about. It is like magic.',

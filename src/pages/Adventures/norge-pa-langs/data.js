I dreaming about a life full of adventures and love the challenges that comes with these expeditions.',
    descriptionFive: 'My partner Stig-Rune has for a long time dreamed about Norge På Langs, and different from me he is living "the 9-5 life" and for him it is now right time to take a break in his life to just enjoy life, explore the beautiful nature of Norway, no alarm clocks, no stress and no commitments. His 9 year old daughter will join us at least twice under the trip for about one week at the time.',
    descriptionSix: 'Our dog Storm will be with us at least all the way to Finnmark. Maybe he will head home when we are crossing Finnmarksvidda due to the mosquitos there.  Storm is a pointer and he loves to spend time in the mountains. His favourite time of the year is the autumn when he is hunting grouse. You can follow him on Instagram  @Stormthepointer.',

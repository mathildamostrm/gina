    descriptionOne:
      'My name is Regina Johansen, I grew up on a farm with horses and ponies in the country-side of Sweden, in a little town called Färgelanda. My passion is travel and adventure, pushing myself outside of my comfort zone and to my limits.',
    descriptionTwo: 'The travel bug bit me early - just after I left school at 15 to follow my dream to work with show jumping horses for a top international stable. Here, I worked at Springfield farm for Alexander & Daniel Zetterman for almost 3 ½ years. In this role, I worked the European showjumping circuit, and got to travel around Europe to some of the biggest shows. They were long days, but very rewarding and character building days. At age 19 (2010), I decided I wanted to see more of the world, so I moved to Sydney, Australia. I started working in the Thoroughbred Horse Racing industry and have now worked in some of the biggest racing stables as a track rider, stablehand and travelling track rider. I have been blessed to work with and learn from the best, including Bart Cummings, Anthony Cummings, Chris Waller and John Thompson.',
    descriptionThree: 'My involvement with horses has been a big part of my life and enabled me to travel and grow, however I am now looking for a new adventure. This is where Trail Running enters my life. I have fallen in love with Trail Running and especially the beauty and Challenge of the Mountains, so this is what will dictate my next travel adventures. On May the 14th 2016 I left Sydney on a bicycle, a tent and four pannier bags;  I cycled the east coast, 2700kms to Cairns, there I  stayed for 2 months. In September 2016, I relocated to New Zealand to live, work and run in the Mountain environment before  traveled back to Sydney, In May 2017 I traveled over to Europe and stayed for 3 months to come back early 2018 to take on my big winter expedition North Cape to Sweden through 3 countries on skis on my own. I fell in love with the almost untouched nature here in  Finnmark and Mageroya, - the wilderness and the endless landscapes to explore here, far north above the arctic circle. In May 2018 I moved to Mageroya to get closer to this incredible nature and fulfil my dream to live with magical nature outside my doorstep.',
    descriptionFour: 'On the horizon  I have Projects like Yukon Arctic Ultra in Canada and walking "Norway on langs" summer 2019,  - but the possibilities are endless and that is the exciting thing about living a adventurers life -  and pushing my selves to new limits.',
    descriptionFive: 'Follow my adventures on my Instagram @ginajohansen91, and my blog here on my website.',
